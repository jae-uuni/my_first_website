    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used 
    for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written 
    in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG,
     </p>MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, 
     alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
    CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, 
    including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility
