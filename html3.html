    <p>JavaScipt often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and
         core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.
          As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,
          [10] often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated 
          JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>
        JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms t
        o the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation,
         and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, a
         nd imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs)
          for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
